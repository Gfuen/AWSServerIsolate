# AWSServerIsolate

AWS Incident Response Tool

The following project is a Python IR Project that will help Cloud teams to isolate Individual
AWS EC2 Servers while removing the EC2 Server Public IP Address, Security Groups,
and IAM Instance role for further investigation.

Feel to free to use and give any feedback. Thank you.
